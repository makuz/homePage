                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently my fields of interest are focused on learning Big Data, AI and Machine Learning technologies</br></br>
                    I am also giving thoughts and implementing solutions on how can I combine my music skills and my programming skills.</br>
                    To develop this interests I am using now among others the Sonic PI environment wich is a programming language environment for creating music.
                    As I go further into programming I begin to see more and more similarities between programming and composing music.
                    This similarities are for example beetwen design patterns and music forms or list of objects comparing to scales in music.<br />
